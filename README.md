# React Project Starter

This starter project has everything you need to start writing React as fast as possible. 

No need for configuration, works out of the box by installing dependencies and starting the development server with `npm start`.

Once you clone this project you can make it your own by removing the existing `.git` folder and initialising a new one.

```
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'Initial commit'
```

If you want to push this project to your GitHub account, create a new repository, copy its URL and add an `origin` remote:

```
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git push -u origin master
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
